# A simple use case of governance
Let's consider the following use case: in an organization, we have three employees - Alice, Bob, and Charlie - distributed across different departments:



- Alice works in the IT Department
- Bob works in the Finance Department
- Charlie works in the Human Resources Department

The organization's governance rules are configured as follows:



- The IT Department has access to all models, with quotas and rate limits
- The Finance Department does not have access to external models only self-hosted.
- The Human Resources Department has access to all models with unlimited budget
